              Evidence from the {U.S}. Housing Market",

              Wing, Ian Sue",
  abstract = "A typical U.S. homebuyer's understanding of whether a property
              faces flood risk is based on whether the property is located
              inside the National Flood Insurance Program's (NFIP) Special
              Flood Hazard Area (SFHA). The SFHA boundary, however, may bias
              homebuyers' perceptions of flood risk relative to unobserved true
              risk because the SFHA is an incomplete, and sometimes inaccurate,
              representation of flood hazards. Using a national dataset of
              property transactions, flood hazard data from the First Street
              Foundation, state-level measures of flood disclosure laws, and a
              spatially restricted triple-difference design, we distinguish
              capitalization effects of policy-driven (SFHA) versus
              quasi-objective (First Street) indicators of flood hazard. We
              identify these effects by assessing thousands of local spatial
              interactions between property SFHA designations, measures of
              quasi-objective flood hazard, and being in a state that mandates
              flood history disclosures. Being inside the SFHA generates a risk
              discount, but the signal is muted relative to underlying hazard
              exposure. Further, the SFHA signal can result in inefficient
              discounts for properties erroneously mapped in the SFHA.
              Disclosure requirements about flood history accentuate price
              effects for hazardous properties and result in more adequate risk
              internalization. In the absence of disclosures, however, we find
              either no or a weak risk signal for houses outside the SFHA that
              face flood hazard. Our results highlight potential benefits of
              updating SFHA boundaries to include all houses that may
              experience flooding, and argue in favor of requiring
              flood-related disclosures from sellers to improve the market's
              ability to internalize flood risk.",

  abstract  = "This paper examines the impact of two nationwide reforms to the
               National Flood Insurance Program on both flood insurance and
               property markets. The 2012 and 2014 reforms aimed to phase out
               subsidies on flood insurance premiums. Using a
               difference-in-differences framework comparing treated and
               similar but untreated properties, we find that the reforms led
               to a 14.3\% relative increase in the price of flood insurance,
               an 8.2\% decrease in insurance demand, a 4.2\% decrease in
               property prices and a 2.3\% decrease in property transaction
               volumes. As flood risk continues to accelerate across the United

               discourage households from living in risky areas, but may
               involve potential trade-offs such as the unintended outcome of a
               large drop-off in insurance coverage.",

               the magnitude of unpriced flood risk in the housing market by
               comparing the empirical and economically efficient prices for
               properties at risk. We find that residential properties exposed
               to flood risk are overvalued by US$121--{}US$237 billion,
               depending on the discount rate. In general, highly overvalued
               properties are concentrated in counties along the coast with no
               flood risk disclosure laws and where there is less concern about
               climate change. Low-income households are at greater risk of
               losing home equity from price deflation, and municipalities that
               are heavily reliant on property taxes for revenue are vulnerable
               to budgetary shortfalls. The consequences of these financial

              conducted zero waste and carbon neutral planning efforts. Here we
              present the results of an accompanying analysis of the impacts of
              zero waste strategies on greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions
              associated with waste treatment. Emissions analysis in the waste
              sector is complicated by the contribution of significant indirect
              impacts that can exhibit temporal and spatial heterogeneity. For
              example, lifecycle GHG analysis of waste-to-energy combustion
              grants credits for the emissions avoided due to electricity
              generated from organic waste (biogenic carbon) that displaces
              electricity generation that could be carbon-emitting. As
              electricity grids decarbonize, this credit approaches zero.
              Long-term emissions planning needs to account for such dynamics
              to realistically assess the GHG mitigation potential associated
              with alternative waste management strategies. Here, we seek to
              capture these dynamics in a forward-looking analysis of waste
              sector emissions under a zero-waste strategy for the City of
              Boston. Using publicly available data sets such as EPA's Waste
              Reduction Model (WARM), we show that the implementation of zero
              waste strategies reduces the combustion of plastics and biomass
              in waste-to-energy (WtE) combustion facilities and associated GHG
              emissions. While WtE has been considered less-carbon intensive
              than other forms of waste treatment and fossil-based electricity
              generation, our analysis shows that more renewables will
              eventually eliminate the perceived GHG benefits associated with
              waste-to-energy combustion. While our approach provides
              policymakers with an understanding of the impacts of decisions in
              a dynamic context, we also identify common knowledge gaps in
              conducting forward-looking waste-GHG assessments.",

  abstract  = "Abstract Large-scale estimations of flood losses are often based
               on spatially aggregated inputs. This makes risk assessments
               vulnerable to aggregation bias, a well-studied, sometimes
               substantial outcome in analyses that model fine-grained spatial
               phenomena at coarse spatial units. To evaluate this potential in
               the context of large-scale flood risk assessments, we use data
               from a high-resolution flood hazard model and structure
               inventory for over 1.3 million properties in Massachusetts and
               examine how prominent data aggregation approaches affect the
               magnitude and spatial distribution of flood loss estimates. All
               considered aggregation approaches rely on aggregate structure
               inventories but differ in whether flood hazard is also
               aggregated. We find that aggregating only structure inventories
               slightly underestimates overall losses (?10\% bias), and when
               flood hazard data is spatially aggregated to even relatively
               small spatial units (census block), statewide aggregation bias
               can reach +366\%. All aggregation-based procedures fail to
               capture the spatial covariation of inputs distributions in the
               upper tails that disproportionately generate total expected
