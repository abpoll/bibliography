  abstract = "Human-system responses to infrastructure projects are an important
              but overlooked driver of complex climate risks. For example,
              levees are commonly constructed to reduce flood hazards in
              low-lying areas and promote population and economic growth. Many
              studies show that levee construction achieves these goals but may
              also increase flood exposure to the point that overall risk
              increases beyond tolerable levels. Infrastructure planning
              practices tend not to account for this ``levee effect,'' biasing
              decision-makers towards large structural defense projects. One
              reason planning practices do not account for the levee effect is
              that it is difficult to model the dynamics that emerge from levee
              construction. In this study, we examine how uncertainties in flood
              hazard, levee fragility, and household decision-making contribute
              to the occurrence and strength of the levee effect in coastal
              environments. We find that flood impacts from extreme events
              post-levee construction are highly sensitive to factors related to
              household behavior towards flooding and levee breaching. By
              accounting for the uncertainty in structural failure and household
              awareness of flood risks, city officials may be able to
              simultaneously promote sustainable urban development and improve
              coastal resilience.",

               implement and evaluate strategies for managing flood risks.
               Unfortunately, there is little guidance on how analysts can
               develop measurements that support these tasks. Here we analyse
               how equity can be defined and measured by surveying 167
               peer-reviewed publications that explicitly state an interest in
               equity in the context of flood-risk management. Our main result
               is a taxonomy that systematizes how equity has been, and can be,
               defined and measured in flood-risk research. The taxonomy
               embodies how equity is a pluralistic and unavoidably ethical
               concept. Despite this, we find that most quantitative studies
               fail to motivate or defend critical value judgements on which
               their findings depend. We also find that studies often include
               only a single equity measurement. This practice can overlook
               important trade-offs between competing perspectives on equity.
               For example, the few studies that employ distinct principles
               show that conclusions about equity depend on which principle
               underlies a specific measurement and how that principle is
               operationalized. We draw on our analysis to suggest practices
               for developing more useful equity indicators and performing more
               comprehensive quantitative equity assessments in the broader
               context of environmental risks. Flood-risk management strategies
               are increasingly incorporating equity considerations, but
               measuring equity poses challenges. This study maps observed
               equity indicators to a taxonomy to help analysts develop robust
               evidence about equity when managing uneven exposure to
               environmental harms.",

  abstract = "A typical U.S. homebuyer's understanding of whether a property
              faces flood risk is based on whether the property is located
              inside the National Flood Insurance Program's (NFIP) Special
              Flood Hazard Area (SFHA). The SFHA boundary, however, may bias
              homebuyers' perceptions of flood risk relative to unobserved true
              risk because the SFHA is an incomplete, and sometimes inaccurate,
              representation of flood hazards. Using a national dataset of
              property transactions, flood hazard data from the First Street
              Foundation, state-level measures of flood disclosure laws, and a
              spatially restricted triple-difference design, we distinguish
              capitalization effects of policy-driven (SFHA) versus
              quasi-objective (First Street) indicators of flood hazard. We
              identify these effects by assessing thousands of local spatial
              interactions between property SFHA designations, measures of
              quasi-objective flood hazard, and being in a state that mandates
              flood history disclosures. Being inside the SFHA generates a risk
              discount, but the signal is muted relative to underlying hazard
              exposure. Further, the SFHA signal can result in inefficient
              discounts for properties erroneously mapped in the SFHA.
              Disclosure requirements about flood history accentuate price
              effects for hazardous properties and result in more adequate risk
              internalization. In the absence of disclosures, however, we find
              either no or a weak risk signal for houses outside the SFHA that
              face flood hazard. Our results highlight potential benefits of
              updating SFHA boundaries to include all houses that may
              experience flooding, and argue in favor of requiring
              flood-related disclosures from sellers to improve the market's
              ability to internalize flood risk.",

               to a 14.3\% relative increase in the price of flood insurance,
               an 8.2\% decrease in insurance demand, a 4.2\% decrease in

               depending on the discount rate. In general, highly overvalued

              impacts that can exhibit temporal and spatial heterogeneity. For
              example, lifecycle GHG analysis of waste-to-energy combustion
              grants credits for the emissions avoided due to electricity
              generated from organic waste (biogenic carbon) that displaces
              electricity generation that could be carbon-emitting. As
              electricity grids decarbonize, this credit approaches zero.
              Long-term emissions planning needs to account for such dynamics
              to realistically assess the GHG mitigation potential associated
              with alternative waste management strategies. Here, we seek to
              capture these dynamics in a forward-looking analysis of waste
              sector emissions under a zero-waste strategy for the City of
              Boston. Using publicly available data sets such as EPA's Waste
              Reduction Model (WARM), we show that the implementation of zero
              waste strategies reduces the combustion of plastics and biomass
              in waste-to-energy (WtE) combustion facilities and associated GHG
              emissions. While WtE has been considered less-carbon intensive
              than other forms of waste treatment and fossil-based electricity
              generation, our analysis shows that more renewables will
              eventually eliminate the perceived GHG benefits associated with
              waste-to-energy combustion. While our approach provides
              policymakers with an understanding of the impacts of decisions in
              a dynamic context, we also identify common knowledge gaps in
              conducting forward-looking waste-GHG assessments.",

               depends on whether this risk is reflected accurately in house
               prices. We assess the degree to which these prices reflect
               storm-related risk versus amenities, and how storms change this
               relationship, with a statistical model that uses an objective
               procedure to choose among nearly one thousand variables that may
               affect house prices in the Florida Keys before and after
               Hurricane Irma. Results suggest that house prices are determined
               largely by amenities. Storms increase the importance of features
               related to structural defense and change their prices such that
               Hurricane Irma raises the price for most houses and lowers the
               price for others. Consequently, the expected market wide decline
               in prices does not appear. Furthermore, prices for features
               related to structural defense may not accurately reflect risk,
               which could increase storm-related losses and inequitable
               outcomes over time, and highlights the need for interventions to
               provide accurate signals about risk.",

  abstract  = "Abstract Large-scale estimations of flood losses are often based
               on spatially aggregated inputs. This makes risk assessments
               vulnerable to aggregation bias, a well-studied, sometimes
               substantial outcome in analyses that model fine-grained spatial
               phenomena at coarse spatial units. To evaluate this potential in
               the context of large-scale flood risk assessments, we use data
               from a high-resolution flood hazard model and structure
               inventory for over 1.3 million properties in Massachusetts and
               examine how prominent data aggregation approaches affect the
               magnitude and spatial distribution of flood loss estimates. All
               considered aggregation approaches rely on aggregate structure
               inventories but differ in whether flood hazard is also
               aggregated. We find that aggregating only structure inventories
               slightly underestimates overall losses (?10\% bias), and when
               flood hazard data is spatially aggregated to even relatively
               small spatial units (census block), statewide aggregation bias
               can reach +366\%. All aggregation-based procedures fail to
               capture the spatial covariation of inputs distributions in the
               upper tails that disproportionately generate total expected
               losses. Our findings are robust to several key assumptions, add
               important context to published risk assessments and highlight
               opportunities to improve flood loss estimation uncertainty
