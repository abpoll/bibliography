  abstract = "Policies and interventions that help individuals defend against
              and cope with the most damaging natural disaster in the US
              require flood risk estimates over large spatial scales. These
              rely on Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and United
              States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) synthetic, expert based,
              depth damage functions (DDFs) that lack empirical validation even
              though this transfer function is often found as the most
              important component of the flood loss modeling process. Here, we
              perform a validation of damage functions on a dataset of 40 times
              more unique events and 10,000 times more observations than the
              next most expansive empirical effort. In our analysis, we develop
              a range of empirical functions and test them against FEMA/USACE
              DDF prediction benchmarks in external validation. Finally, we
              apply the benchmark and empirical models to a dataset of over 140
              million single family homes in the US, with flood loss drivers
              specified at the property level, to observe the implications of
              estimator differences from property to aggregate scales. Internal
              to the loss data, we find that each estimator yields
              approximately mean unbiased estimates. However, they disagree
              substantially at the property level since losses are highly
              heterogeneous, even conditioned on the set of observables
              available for use in large scale flood loss estimation. These
              differences have surprising implications on the estimated flood
              loss distribution to single family homes in the US. Flood loss
              estimates aggregated from census block to county and state levels
              agree to a greater extent than expected across estimators in
              terms of absolute and rank ordering of losses. Property level
              losses agree to a lesser extent, but more than expected based off
              validation internal to the loss data. The level of agreement at
              any scale varies over space (i.e. FEMA Region). While losses are
              sensitive to the choice of damage estimator, our results provide
              strong evidence that flood risk management decisions at aggregate
              scales may be reliably informed by flood loss estimates. We make
              our preferred and easy to use empirical damage functions openly
              available and discuss how they could be used in large scale flood
              loss estimation to improve the understanding of flood risk to
              single family homes in the US and opportunities to effectively
              manage that risk. Future work will focus on improving the
              validity of damage functions examined here, generating
              predictions under uncertainty, and understanding the scales at
              which predictions can be applied reliably in different settings.",
